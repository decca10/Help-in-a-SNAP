Upon doing a gridsearch for the best hyperparameters, I was surprised to discover that bootstrapping in the Random Forest was not optimal, but using bootstrapping within the Bagging Classifier improved performance.  I ended up with a cross validated accuracy score of 95%, and the Bagging Classifier had boosted precision and recall to 95%.  \n",
